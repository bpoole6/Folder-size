# Folder-size
Transverses the file system calculating the size of folders

The main method is in FileSystemSize. You'll need to tweak at least 2 variables inside the FileSystemSize.

**ROOT_FOLDER** --> You'll need to modify this to point to the folder location you want to transverse.

**MAX_DEPTH** --> This controls how far down you want to collect individual folder details. Play around with this value to see what I mean.

## Run FileSystemSize
After you run the main file navigate to the html/data.js. The file should be updated with the serialized data of the execution. Open up html/index.html 
in chrome/firefox/not edge/safari/etc. You should see something to this effect
